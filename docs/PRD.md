# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
## Immersive Webpages - Web 4.0 Platform

**Product Name:** Immersive Webpages
**Version:** 1.0
**Owner:** Fabio Hartmann Fernandes (Solo Developer)
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-21
**Status:** Pre-Development (Phase 0 - Documentation)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Immersive Webpages is a revolutionary platform that transforms traditional 2D websites into fully interactive 3D experiences powered by Unreal Engine 5.6 and pixel streaming technology. When users visit an immersive webpage, scrolling moves a camera through photorealistic 3D worlds rather than moving content on a flat page.

**Vision:** Make UE5-powered immersive websites the new standard for premium brands and enable thousands of content creators to build pixel streaming experiences.

**Business Model:**
1. Custom immersive website development for brands (R$200k-3M/year per client)
2. Professional templates sold on Epic Fab marketplace ($249-399 each)
3. Hosting partnership referral fees (10-20% of hosting revenue)

**Target Revenue (Year 5):** R$45.78M/year ($8.05M USD)
