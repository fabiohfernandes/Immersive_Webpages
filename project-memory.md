**Strategy:** Submit with Natura demo (working or mockup) + passionate pitch video

### Phase 3: Sell to Natura (Months 7-9) - NOT STARTED
**Goal:** First paying client - R$500k-1.5M/year contract
**Backup:** O Botic√°rio, Havaianas, BYD if Natura declines

### Phase 4: Build Company (Year 1-2) - NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Scale to 10-30 clients
**Revenue Target:** R$6M-10M/year

### Phase 5: Free Template + Premium Marketplace (Year 3) - NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Platform approach - free template drives paid custom services
**Revenue Target:** R$27.9M/year (custom projects + maintenance + templates + consulting)

### Phase 6: Professional Templates for Epic Fab Marketplace (Year 3-4) - NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Create and sell professional templates on Epic's Fab marketplace
**Deliverables:**
- FREE starter template (marketing funnel)
- 8 professional templates ($249-399 each)
- 8 add-on packs ($49-199 each)
**Revenue Target:** R$16.2M/year by Year 5 (10,000 sales)

### Phase 7: Hosting Partnerships (Year 4-5) - NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Partner with hosting companies to provide turnkey pixel streaming solutions
**Model:** Referral-based (10-20% of hosting fees as passive income)
**Partners:** PS5 network providers, cloud hosting companies, our separate hosting branch

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Direct hosting infrastructure is handled by SEPARATE company/branch. This project creates CONTENT (websites + templates) and earns referral fees from hosting partnerships.

---

## üí° KEY STRATEGIC DECISIONS MADE

### Decision 1: This is NOT InFigital
**Date:** 2025-01-21
**Decision:** Immersive Webpages is Fabio's SOLO project, completely separate from InFigital company
**Rationale:** Different vision, different business model, different target market
**Impact:** All documents cleaned of InFigital references

### Decision 2: Template Business Model Clarified
**Date:** 2025-01-21
**Decision:** Free template = Marketing funnel (NOT the revenue source!)
**Revenue Streams:**
1. Custom client projects (R$200k-3M/year each) - PRIMARY (72%)
2. Annual maintenance (R$50k-300k/year) - RECURRING (14%)
3. Premium templates ($49-299 each) - MARKETPLACE (1%)
4. Consulting & training ($200/hour) - SUPPLEMENTARY (4%)
5. White-label licensing ($50k-200k/year) - ENTERPRISE (9%)

**Rationale:** Free template brings leads who then pay for custom development services
**Model:** Like WordPress (free software) ‚Üí Leads to paid custom development

**IMPORTANT:** Hosting is handled by separate company branch - NOT part of revenue model here

### Decision 3: Hosting is SEPARATE Project
**Date:** 2025-01-21 (CRITICAL CLARIFICATION)
**Decision:** Hosting infrastructure (PS5 network, decentralized pixel streaming) is handled by SEPARATE company branch
**Rationale:**
- This project = Build and SELL immersive websites (content creation)
- Other branch = Handle ALL hosting infrastructure (heavy lifting)
- We create DEMAND for them by building great websites
- They do the hosting deployment/servers/infrastructure
**Impact:**
- Removed Phase 5-7 (hosting business) from roadmap
- Changed from 7 phases to 5 phases
- Revenue target adjusted from R$42.8M to R$27.9M (Year 3)
- Focus is 100% on website creation, NOT infrastructure
- Hosting can be offered as optional add-on through partner

### Decision 4: Focus on Epic MegaGrants First
**Date:** 2025-01-21
**Decision:** Apply to Epic MegaGrants before building full demo
**Rationale:**
- $100k-150k covers development costs
- Epic credibility validates concept
- PR value from being MegaGrants recipient
- Can bootstrap if rejected (Phase 3 happens either way)

### Decision 5: Natura as Primary Demo Target
**Date:** Oct 2025 (original vision)
**Decision:** Build Natura sustainability brand demo (not automotive, not real estate)
**Rationale:**
- Brazilian company (easier to pitch)
- Visually stunning (rainforest showcases UE5 best)
- Sustainability theme (aligns with Epic's values)
- Clear product integration (soaps, shampoos in nature scene)
- Viral potential ("Have you SEEN this website?!")
