- Occlusion Culling: Hide objects not visible to camera
- Distance Culling: Fade out distant objects
- Texture Streaming: Load high-res textures only when needed
- Blueprint Nativization: Convert blueprints to C++ for shipping build

**Mobile-Specific:**
- Reduce foliage density (50% of desktop)
- Disable expensive effects (god rays, volumetric fog)
- Lower shadow resolution
- Simplify water (fewer ripples)
- Adaptive quality: Detect FPS, reduce settings if < 25 FPS

### Pixel Streaming Setup:

**Server-Side (UE5):**
- Pixel Streaming Plugin enabled
- Streamer runs on port 8888
- Signaling server on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS)

**Client-Side (Browser):**
- WebRTC connection
- Receives H.264 video stream
- Sends input events (mouse, keyboard, touch)
- Adaptive bitrate (adjust quality based on bandwidth)

**Infrastructure:**
- 4 PS5 render units (can handle 4 concurrent users each = 16 total)
- Matchmaker routes users to least-loaded unit
- Auto-scaling: Spin up more units if demand > capacity

- Key: C major (happy, open)
- Tempo: 70-80 BPM (calm)
- Dynamic: Swells during descent, mellows at forest floor
- Length: 3-4 minutes (long enough to avoid repetition annoyance)

### Sound Effects:

**Nature Sounds:**
- Birds: Macaw calls, toucan chirps, general songbirds
- Insects: Cicadas (day), crickets (night)
- Animals: Monkey howls, frog croaks, rustling in bushes
- Wind: Gentle breeze (constant), gusts (periodic)
- Water: Creek babbling, waterfall roar, rain patter

**Interaction Sounds:**
- Click: Soft "pop" (satisfying, not annoying)
- Add to cart: "Ding!" (success sound)
- Open info card: "Whoosh" (paper slide)
- Time change: Subtle chime
- Weather change: Transition whoosh

**Spatialization (3D Audio):**
- Bird to your left → Sound comes from left speaker/headphone
- Waterfall behind you → Sound comes from rear (if surround sound)
- Walk closer to creek → Water gets louder
- Turn away from waterfall → Volume decreases

**Implementation:**
- UE5 Audio System (built-in spatialization)
- Attenuation: Sound fades over distance
- Occlusion: Trees block sound (muffled if object between source and listener)
