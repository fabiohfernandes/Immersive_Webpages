# CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS - IMMERSIVE WEBPAGES PROJECT

**Project Owner:** Fabio Hartmann Fernandes
**Location:** Florian√≥polis, SC, Brazil
**Project Type:** Solo Developer - Epic MegaGrants Application
**Status:** Pre-Application Phase

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Name:** Immersive Webpages - Web 4.0 Platform
**Vision:** Build the world's first decentralized immersive web platform powered by Unreal Engine 5 + Pixel Streaming
**Core Innovation:** Transform traditional 2D websites into fully interactive 3D experiences where scrolling moves a camera through photorealistic worlds

---

## CRITICAL GUARDRAILS - NON-NEGOTIABLE

### Hard Rules
* **READ PROJECT-MEMORY.MD FIRST** - At EVERY new session/chat/interaction start, read [project-memory.md](project-memory.md) to load current project state
* **UPDATE PROJECT-MEMORY.MD** - After major tasks completed, problems resolved, or milestones achieved, update project-memory.md
* **No InFigital references** - This is Fabio's SOLO project, not InFigital company
* **Honesty First** - NEVER lie about task completion. Use clear placeholders if something isn't done
* **No Placeholders as Solutions** - Always make clear what's implemented vs. what's planned
* **Ask Before Acting** - ALWAYS ask for permission to proceed ("next" or "yes")
* **Testing Gates** - Propose testing after milestone completion
* **Git Protocol** - Ask "Commit and Push?" after major tasks
* **Development Log** - Ask "Actualize development?" after completing phases
* **User Authority** - Fabio has full authority; don't decide independently
* **Transparency** - If you don't know how to solve something, say so clearly
* **Be Kind** - Fabio is under pressure; be comprehensive and supportive

## FABIO'S MASTER ROADMAP (The Real Plan)

This is the ACTUAL sequence Fabio is following - ALWAYS reference this:

### Phase 1: Build Natura Demo (Months 1-6)
- Create stunning Natura immersive webpage demo
- Full experience: Clouds ‚Üí Rainforest ‚Üí Products
- Features: Time of day, weather, AI toucan, shopping cart
- Deliverable: Working demo + template framework

### Phase 2: Epic MegaGrants Approval (Months 4-8)
- **Target:** Secure $100k-150k funding from Epic
- Use demo to prove concept
- Promise open-source template + case study
- Show UE5 can power entire websites (new market!)

### Phase 3: Sell to Natura (Months 7-9)
- **Goal:** First paying client - R$500k-1.5M/year contract
- Pitch live demo to Natura marketing team
- Show engagement metrics potential (10X normal sites)
- Backup: O Botic√°rio, Havaianas, BYD if Natura declines

### Phase 4: Build Company (Year 1-2)
- Scale from 1 client to 10-30 clients
- Service model: Build custom immersive websites
- Pricing: R$200k-3M/year per client
- Target: R$6M-10M/year revenue

### Phase 5: Free Template + Premium Marketplace (Year 3)
- Open-source basic template (GitHub, MIT license)
- Freemium model: Free template ‚Üí Paid custom services
- Sell premium templates on Unreal Marketplace
- Luxury Fashion ($199), Automotive ($299), Real Estate ($149), etc.
- Target: 10,000 sales/year = $1.75M revenue

**Year 3 Target Revenue:** R$27.9M/year ($4.9M USD)

**CRITICAL:** Hosting is handled by SEPARATE company branch - NOT this project's responsibility!

---

## THE TEMPLATE SYSTEM - BUSINESS MODEL CLARIFICATION

**Key Understanding:**
- **Free Template** = Marketing funnel (lead generation!)
- **Revenue** = Service + Premium templates + Consulting

### How Money is Made:

1. **Client Projects** (PRIMARY Revenue - 72%): R$200k-3M/year per custom build
   - Example: Natura hires Fabio for R$800k/year
   - Uses template as foundation, customizes everything
   - Clients pay for expertise, not template

2. **Annual Maintenance** (RECURRING Revenue - 14%): R$50k-300k/year per client
   - Updates, bug fixes, technical support
   - Content updates, seasonal changes
   - **Note:** Hosting handled by separate company branch

3. **Premium Templates** (MARKETPLACE - 1%): $49-299 each
   - Production-ready, industry-specific
   - Saves developers weeks of work
   - Passive income stream

4. **Consulting & Training** (SUPPLEMENTARY - 4%): $200/hour, courses, workshops
   - Help agencies build immersive sites
   - Teach others the framework

5. **White-Label Licensing** (ENTERPRISE - 9%): $50k-200k/year
   - Agencies rebrand template for their clients
   - Technical support included

**The Genius:** Free template is the DEMO that leads to PAID custom development services!

**IMPORTANT:** Hosting infrastructure (PS5 network, pixel streaming servers) is managed by SEPARATE company branch. Immersive Webpages creates the CONTENT/WEBSITES. The other branch handles the HOSTING. We can offer hosting as optional add-on, but it's not our core business.

---

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Primary Deliverable: Natura Demo

**URL:** immersive-webpages.com/natura
**Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.6
**Features:**
- Lumen (real-time global illumination)
- Nanite (billions of polygons, film-quality)
- Niagara (particle systems)
- MetaHuman (AI avatars)
- Chaos Physics (water, cloth simulation)
- Pixel Streaming (WebRTC delivery)

### Core Innovation: Scroll-to-Camera System
```
User scrolls webpage
  ‚Üì
JavaScript captures scroll delta
  ‚Üì
Send to UE5 via WebRTC data channel
  ‚Üì
Blueprint moves camera along spline path
  ‚Üì
New frame rendered and streamed back
```

### Infrastructure Note
- **Hosting:** Handled by SEPARATE company branch (not this project!)
- **This project:** Builds UE5 websites/content only
- **Hosting can be offered:** As optional add-on through partner branch
- **Focus:** Website creation, not infrastructure management

---

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### Always Follow These Steps:

1. **Read First**
   - Check FABIO-ROADMAP-AND-STRATEGY.md for current phase
   - Verify what's already documented
   - Understand Fabio's actual vision (not assumptions!)

2. **Propose, Don't Decide**
   - Present options with recommendations
   - Ask "Should I proceed with X approach?"
   - Wait for explicit "yes" or "next"

3. **Be Explicit About Status**
   - "This is 80% complete, remaining: X, Y, Z"
   - "This is a placeholder - needs actual implementation"
   - "I'm unsure about X - let me research options"

4. **Milestone Gates**
   - After completing major tasks: "Ready to test?"
   - After testing: "Commit and Push?"
   - After phases: "Actualize development.md?"

5. **Error Handling**
   - Don't use workarounds without asking
   - Be honest if errors persist
   - Propose solutions, let Fabio decide

- Timeline
- Pricing strategy
- Technical approach
- Phase sequencing

**Everything else supports that master plan.**
