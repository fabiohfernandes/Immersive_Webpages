# EPIC MEGAGRANTS - IMMERSIVE WEBPAGES PROJECT PLAN

**Project Name:** Immersive Webpages - Web 4.0 Powered by UE5
**Lead:** Fabio Hartmann Fernandes (Solo Developer)
**Grant Request:** $100,000 - $150,000 USD
**Timeline:** 6 months
**Goal:** Build world's first production-ready UE5-powered immersive website platform

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**What we're building:** A platform that transforms traditional 2D websites into fully interactive 3D experiences powered by Unreal Engine 5.6 and pixel streaming. When users scroll, they move a camera through photorealistic 3D worlds - not just content on a page.

**Why Epic should fund this:**
- **New market for UE5:** 200 million websites vs. 3 million game developers (66X larger TAM!)
- **Technical innovation:** First scroll-to-camera interaction paradigm, 360° content architecture
- **Solo developer vision:** Pure creative focus, no corporate constraints
- **Democratization:** Cost-optimized (1/10th AWS pricing) makes UE5 accessible to emerging markets
- **Impact:** Proves UE5 can power the entire internet, not just games

---

## THE VISION: WEB 4.0

### Current Web (Web 2.0/3.0):
- Flat 2D pages (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Limited interactivity (click buttons, fill forms)
- Boring visual experiences (text and images)

### Immersive Webpages (Web 4.0):
- **3D worlds** rendered in real-time by Unreal Engine 5
- **Scroll = camera movement** through immersive environments
- **360° content** (front, left, right, back = 4X more information!)
- **Dynamic themes** (day/night cycles instead of dark mode)
- **AI avatars** (MetaHuman receptionists that answer questions)
- **Interactive products** (open car doors, change colors, physics simulations)

---

## WHAT WE'LL BUILD WITH EPIC FUNDING

### Primary Deliverable: NATURA DEMO
**The hero experience showcasing full platform capabilities**

**Experience Flow:**
1. **Sky (Opening):** Float in clouds at 3,000m, volumetric clouds, god rays, birds flying
2. **Descent:** Scroll down, camera descends through clouds into Amazon rainforest
3. **Canopy:** Interactive trees (click to learn about ingredients: açaí, cupuaçu)
4. **Forest Floor:** Crystal creek, waterfall, Natura products placed naturally
5. **Interactions:** Time of day slider (dawn/noon/sunset/night), weather toggle, AI toucan guide

**Why Natura:**
- Brazilian sustainability brand (perfect fit for Epic's values!)
- Visually stunning (rainforest showcases UE5 Lumen, Nanite, Niagara)
- Clear business case (R$800k-1.5M/year pricing = proves viability)
- Viral potential ("Have you SEEN this website?!")

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Team Hiring Difficulty
**Mitigation:**
- Recruit globally (remote-first)
- Partner with Brazilian game dev schools (SENAC, PUCRS)
- Offer equity in addition to salary (upside potential)
- Start recruitment now (don't wait for funding confirmation)

### Risk 2: Natura Doesn't Sign
**Mitigation:**
- Demo is valuable regardless (portfolio piece)
- Pitch to other sustainability brands (O Boticário, Havaianas)
- Pivot to automotive (BYD) or real estate (Cyrela)
- Template system still valuable for ecosystem

### Risk 3: Performance Issues (Mobile)
**Mitigation:**
- Optimize early and often (don't wait till end)
- LOD system (reduce detail on mobile)
- Adaptive quality (detect device, adjust graphics)
- Fallback to 2D version if WebRTC not supported

### Risk 4: Cost Overruns
**Mitigation:**
- Detailed budget with 2% contingency
- Milestone-based spending (don't pay contractors upfront)
- Fabio can do more himself if needed (reduce contractor hours)
- Focus on MVP (nice-to-haves can wait)
