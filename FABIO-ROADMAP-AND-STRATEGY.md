# FABIO'S ROADMAP & BUSINESS STRATEGY
## Immersive Webpages - The Real Plan

**Creator:** Fabio Hartmann Fernandes (Solo Developer)
**Date:** 2025
**Vision:** Build and sell immersive 3D websites powered by Unreal Engine 5

---

## THE MASTER PLAN (5 PHASES)

### PHASE 1: BUILD THE DEMO (Months 1-6)
**Goal:** Create stunning Natura demo to prove the concept

**What I'm building:**
- Natura Immersive Webpage (full experience)
  - Clouds â†’ Rainforest â†’ Products
  - Time of day, weather, AI toucan
  - Shopping cart, checkout flow
  - Mobile-responsive

**Deliverables:**
- Working demo at immersive-webpages.com/natura
- 5-min demo video for Epic
- Template framework (foundation for future projects)

**Funding:**
- Epic MegaGrants: $100k-150k (covering development costs)
- If Epic says no: Bootstrap with personal savings

**Success metric:**
- Demo is so beautiful people say "WOW!"
- Epic is impressed enough to fund it

---

### PHASE 2: GET EPIC MEGAGRANTS APPROVAL (Months 4-8)
**Goal:** Secure $100k-150k funding from Epic

**Strategy:**
- Submit application with:
  - Natura demo (working or mockup)
  - This roadmap document
  - Passionate pitch video (me talking about Web 4.0)
  - Clear business model (NOT just charity - this makes money!)

**What I promise Epic:**
- World-class Natura demo (showcase UE5 capabilities)
- Open-source template (benefits UE5 community)
- Case study for Epic blog (PR value for them)
- Proof that UE5 can power entire websites (new market!)

**If approved:**
- Use $150k for team (UE5 dev, 3D artist, UI/UX)
- Build Natura demo in 6 months
- Open-source template system

**If rejected:**
- Bootstrap Phase 3 anyway (pitch Natura without Epic funding)
- Build simpler demo with personal savings
- Reapply to Epic later with traction

---

### PHASE 3: SELL TO NATURA (Month 7-9)
**Goal:** Convert demo into PAID CLIENT (R$800k-1.5M/year contract!)

**The Pitch:**
- "Natura, I built this immersive website FOR YOU"
- Show live demo (let them explore the rainforest!)
- Present metrics potential:
  - 3-5 min session time (vs. 30 sec on normal sites)
  - 10X engagement, 5X conversion rates
  - Viral potential ("Have you SEEN Natura's website?!")

**Pricing Options:**

| Package | Price (R$/year) | What They Get |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Starter** | 300k | Immersive homepage only |
| **Professional** | 800k | 5 immersive pages, AI toucan, advanced features |
| **Enterprise** | 1.5M | Full site conversion, unlimited pages, custom development |

**Note on Hosting:**
- Hosting is handled by separate branch/partner company
- Can be offered as optional add-on
- NOT part of this project's core business

**Success metric:**
- Natura signs contract for minimum R$500k
- First payment received (proves business model!)

**Backup plan if Natura says no:**
- Pitch to O BoticÃ¡rio (competitor)
- Pitch to Havaianas (another Brazilian brand)
- Pitch to BYD (automotive - different demo)
- Someone will say yes (demo is too good to ignore!)

---

### PHASE 4: BUILD IMMERSIVE WEBPAGES COMPANY (Year 1-2)
**Goal:** Scale from 1 client (Natura) to 10-30 clients

**Business Model:**
- **Service:** Build custom immersive websites for brands
- **Target clients:** Luxury brands, automotive, real estate, e-commerce
- **Pricing:** R$200k-3M/year per client
- **Delivery:** Use template framework, customize for each brand

**Year 1 Goals:**
- 3-5 paying clients (R$1.5M-3M total revenue)
- Hire small team (1 UE5 dev, 1 3D artist - part-time/contract)
- Refine template system (make it faster to build)
- Build 2-3 industry templates (automotive, real estate, retail)

**Year 2 Goals:**
- 10-15 paying clients (R$6M-10M total revenue)
- Hire full-time team (3-5 people)
- Expand to other countries (Mexico, Colombia, Argentina)
- Partner with web design agencies (they sell, I build)

**Revenue Streams:**
1. **Custom website builds:** R$200k-3M per project (PRIMARY REVENUE)
2. **Annual maintenance:** R$50k-300k per client/year (RECURRING)
3. **Consulting & training:** Workshops, courses, technical support
4. **White-label licensing:** Agencies rebrand template for their clients ($50k-200k/year)

**Why clients hire me:**
- I'm the ONLY one doing this (first-mover advantage!)
- They saw the Natura demo (social proof!)
- Their competitors will copy them (urgency!)
- ROI is clear (10X engagement = more sales!)

---

### PHASE 5: RELEASE FREE TEMPLATE + MARKETPLACE (Year 3)
**Goal:** Platform approach - free template drives paid services

**The Free Template:**
- Open-source on GitHub (MIT license)
- Basic features:
  - Scroll-to-camera system

  - Shopping cart integration
  - Basic UI widgets

**Documentation:**

- Video series on YouTube
- Sample projects (Natura demo as reference)

**What It DOESN'T Include (Why People Still Hire Me):**
- Advanced features (AI avatars, dynamic weather)
- Premium environments (luxury showrooms, complex scenes)
- Custom 3D models (products, characters)
- Integration with existing systems (Shopify, SAP, etc.)
- Professional polish (lighting, optimization, testing)

**The Freemium Hook:**

```

- Year 5: 10,000 sales Ã— $199 avg = $1.99M

## WHY THIS ROADMAP WORKS

### 1. **De-risked Path to Success:**
- Phase 1-2: Epic funds demo (not my money!)
- Phase 3: Natura validates business (first revenue!)
- Phase 4: Proven model, scale confidently
- Phase 5: Multiple revenue streams (not dependent on one!)

### 2. **First-Mover Advantage:**
- No one else is doing UE5-powered websites at scale
- By Year 3, I'll have 30 case studies (competitors have 0!)
- Category king: "Immersive Webpages" = My brand

### 3. **Scalable:**
- Phase 1-3: Do everything myself (solo dev!)
- Phase 4: Hire team (scale delivery)
- Phase 5: Platform model (templates sell themselves!)

### 4. **Multiple Exit Options:**
- Year 3: Profitable company, could sell for R$50M-100M
- Year 5: Could IPO or sell for R$150M-300M
- Or: Keep running it, R$19M+/year profit is nice! ðŸ˜Š
